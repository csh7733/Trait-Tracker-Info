# Trait-Tracker (https://tft123.site)
---

I was frustrated because I couldn’t think of any good Trait Tracker combinations—so I built this tool.

---

* Achieve **8 synergies with just 7 champions**! (Optional: allow up to 8)
* **Only 1 four-cost champion allowed** (Optional: exclude them completely)
* Automatically analyzes the **Top 5 most frequent champions**
* **Click champions from results** to instantly search again with updated conditions!
* Simulation runs for up to **30 seconds**—automatically stops if it takes too long

**V2.0**

* New algorithm → Much faster search speed
* Pagination added to reduce lag

**V2.1**

* When no champions are selected but emblems are, far more combinations are now explored
* Added a reset button for conditions

**V3.0**

* Added internationalization (i18n : ko,en,zh) -> update more later!

**V4.0**

* Improved UI for better experience on mobile devices

Support ❌ not available. (Just kidding, it is.)
